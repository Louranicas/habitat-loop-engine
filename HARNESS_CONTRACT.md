# Harness Contract

Status: scaffold contract only.

Future S13 execution requires:

- `vault/CONVENTIONS.md` complete;
- JSON schemas under `schemas/`;
- md-to-jsonl emitter;
- jsonl-to-md verifier;
- negative controls proving false passes fail;
- anchored receipts with `^Verdict`, split hash anchors (`^Manifest_sha256` for scaffold manifest evidence and `^Framework_sha256` for source/framework provenance), and `^Counter_evidence_locator`.

`^Source_sha256` is a legacy compatibility alias only. New scaffold receipts must use the split hash anchors so CI/Watcher readers can distinguish manifest integrity from framework provenance.

Scaffold gate only verifies these files exist and are internally linked.

## Comprehensiveness Review — Weaver 2026-05-10

### Purpose
This file is treated as a root or topic documentation surface within the Habitat Loop Engine deployment framework. Its purpose is to make the local-M0/scaffold surface legible to fresh agents without relying on unstated session memory.

### Authority and boundary
- Canonical active repository: `/home/louranicas/claude-code-workspace/habitat-loop-engine`.
- Deployment framework authority: `/home/louranicas/claude-code-workspace/loop-workflow-engine-project/shared-context/loop-workflow-engine/deployment-framework`.
- Dedicated review vault: `/home/louranicas/claude-code-workspace/loop-workflow-engine-project/habitat-loop-engine/habitat-loop-engine`.
- Local M0 is authorized; the codebase needs to be 'one shotted': every runtime path must execute as a bounded, foreground, one-shot operation, and live Habitat write integrations, cron jobs, systemd services, background services, and unbounded daemons remain outside this file's authority.

### Files and directory relationship
- Current file: `HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`.
- Parent directory: `.`.
- Adjacent markdown siblings sampled: ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md, CLAUDE.local.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEOWNERS.md, QUALITY_BAR.md, QUICKSTART.md, README.md.
- This file should be read with `plan.toml`, `ULTRAMAP.md`, `docs/SCRIPT_SPEC_PREDICATE_MAP.md`, and `.deployment-work/status/scaffold-status.json` when deciding whether a change is scaffold-only, local-M0, or outside authorization.

### Verification hooks
- Baseline scaffold gate: `scripts/quality-gate.sh --scaffold --json`.
- Local-M0 gate: `scripts/quality-gate.sh --m0 --json`.
- Manifest authority: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt` after every documentation or status edit.
- For vault/framework-only edits, refresh the appropriate vault/framework manifest before declaring closure.

### Acceptance criteria
- The document names its role, boundary, and verification surface clearly.
- Claims about PASS/FAIL are backed by verifier output or receipts, not prose alone.
- Any runtime behavior described here remains local-only unless a later authorization receipt explicitly expands scope.
- Future agents can identify which files to inspect next without guessing hidden context.

### Failure modes
- Treat vague "complete", "ready", or "deployed" wording as insufficient unless it points to gates, manifests, and receipts.
- Do not infer live integration permission from local-M0 wording.
- Do not create background services or recurring jobs from this document alone.
- If this file drifts from `plan.toml` or `ULTRAMAP.md`, update the authority files first and rerun gates.

### Next maintenance action
On the next broadening pass, re-run the markdown census, inspect files with fewer than 180 words or missing boundary/verification terms, update this section with any new authority roots, then refresh manifests and rerun both quality gates.
